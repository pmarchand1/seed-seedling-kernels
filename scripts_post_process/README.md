# Analysis of model outputs

Scripts in this folder process the output of multiple models (from `run_single_model.R` in the main folder) to generate all the results in the paper. They are numbered in the order they should be run.

- `1_get_mod_avg_wgts.R`: Compile the diagnostic and goodness-of-fit metrics for all models, then calculate the model stacking weights for valid models by species and lifestage.

- `2_compile_mod_avg_results.R`: Using the weighted lists of candidate models from previous script, produce model-averaged posterior distributions for the dispersal kernel, relative survival, dispersal summary statistics and non-dispersal parameters. Much of this work is done via functions found in `disp_curve_funcs.R`.

- `3_create_graphs.R`: Produce graphs from the results generated by the previous script.
